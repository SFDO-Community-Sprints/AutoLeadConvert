<h1>Auto Lead conversion Basics

Trigger lead conversion based on:
Configurable criteria for what should trigger the Conversion. Process builder entrance criteria approach.
OR: Direct trigger (Approachable via PB, Flow, Apex, API)

Configurable what happens during the conversion e.g.
Create contact and account
Set Record types (household)
Create an opportunity
Create Recurring gift

General considerations
Order of execution: First convert, then create and relate new record. This is the most flexible. 
When triggered via API, API should give back ContactID
Incorporate depublication rules
