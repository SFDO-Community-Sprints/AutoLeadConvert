As an NPSP user I would like to be able to convert a lead automatically, so I don't have to do it manually.

- Needs to be flexible 
- Needs to be able to interact with existing no-code tools like Process builder or Flow


Cookbook idea:

Include an Apex class in the NPSP/HEDA which can be called from a PB or Flow which will convert the lead to the contact.

Process:

1. Create Process Builder where you set the criteria on which you want lead to be converted to a contact
2. As a final action in the PB, call the Apex class 
3. Update the newly created contact/opportunity additionally with values from the lead using process builder again
4. ???
5. Profit
